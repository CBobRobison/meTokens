meTokens are issued using a custom automated market maker (AMM), called an **automated discount market maker (ADMM)**.
An ADMM is a liquidity tool that reflexively creates discounts in recessive markets in order to stimulate spending 
with a person when there is less demand for their labor and attention. The ADMM also allows for spenders to gain leverage 
in a growing market when demand for a person is high.
